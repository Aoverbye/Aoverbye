## Hello!

My name is Amanda Overbye and I currently a student of University of California, Santa Barbara pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I am passionate about wildlife ecology, conservation, data science and environmental education. I am using my time at UCSB to develope code that will aid in assessing the range shifts of coastal species along Californias coast. When I am not coding, I love exploring nature, spending time with my dog, reading, and jogging.
