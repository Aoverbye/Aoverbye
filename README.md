## Hello!

My name is Amanda Overbye and I am currently a student of the University of California, Santa Barbara pursuing my Master’s in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I am passionate about wildlife ecology, conservation, data science, and environmental education. I am using my time at UCSB to develope code that will aid in assessing the range shifts of coastal species along Californias coast. When I am not coding, I love exploring nature, spending time with my dog, reading, and jogging. 

## Things I love 🐶

🦇 Working with and learning about wildlife, conservation, and ecology
