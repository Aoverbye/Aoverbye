## Hello!

My name is Amanda Overbye and I am a recent graduate of UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I am passionate about wildlife ecology, conservation, data science, and environmental education. I am using my time at UCSB to develop code that will aid in assessing the range shifts of coastal species along California's coast. When I am not coding, I love exploring nature, spending time with my dog, reading, and jogging. 

## Things I love 🐶

🐍 Learning R, Python, and SQL

🦇 Working with and learning about wildlife, conservation, and ecology

🐾 Hanging out with my dog Moose and teaching him new tricks

🏃‍♀️ Learning new jogging routes and being outside
